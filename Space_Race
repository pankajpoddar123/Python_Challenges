Create a dictionary named captains by using this list of tuples:

[ 
	("Enterprise", "Picard"), 
	("Voyager", "Janeway"), 
	("Defiant", "Sisko"),
]

Then, add another spaceship named "Old Bessie" with captain "Leela" to captains.
Next, store a list of the spaceship names in a variable named spaceships.
Randomly pick three spaceships from spaceships and store them in a list named positions.
Create dictionary named "winners" with the keys 1, 2, 3. The default values should be "unknown" for each key. 
Update the each winner key with the value from positions variable. 
Example 1 for Picard 2 for Janeway etc
Finally, loop over captains and congratulate the captain of the ship with the first ship and motivate the captain who didnâ€™t make it to the top three.

Example
Better luck next time, Picard. 
Congratulations, Sisko!
