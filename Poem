Program that generates poetry
------------------------------
nouns = ["badger", "horse", "aardvark", "mouse", "gorilla", "elephant", "eagle", "sparrow"]
verbs = ["hugs", "bounces", "meows", "hauls", "whispers", "flutters", "gallops", "shimmers"]
adjectives = ["furry", "incredulous", "fragrant", "exuberant", "glistening", "melancholic", "serene"]
prepositions = ["against", "after", "into", "beneath", "upon", "for", "in", "like", "over", "within"]
adverbs = ["curiously", "extravagantly", "graciously", "reluctantly", "meticulously", "vigorously"]

Rule
----
Randomly select the following number of elements from each list:
--> Three nouns
--> Three verbs
--> Three adjectives
--> Two prepositions
--> One adverb
You can do this with the choice() function in the random module.
This function takes a list as input and returns a randomly selected element of the list.

For example, here’s how you use random.choice() to get random element from the list ["a", "b", "c"]: or any other method as per your choice. 

import random
random_element = random.choice(["a","b","c"])


Using the randomly selected words, generate and display a poem with thefollowing structure inspired by Clifford Pickover

=============================================
Format

{article} {adj1} {noun1}

{article} {adj1} {noun1} {verb1} {prep1} the {adj2} {noun2} {adverb1}, the {noun1} {verb2} the {noun2} {verb3} {prep2} the {adj3} {noun3}

Here, adj stands for adjective and prep for preposition. 
Note that article will need to be either A or An depending on the first letter of the next word.
Means if the adj1 is starting with vowel article will be An else A
==========
Example
********
A melancholic aardvark

A melancholic aardvark shimmers like the furry horse extravagantly, the aardvark gallops the horse meows over the incredulous gorilla
